As researchers, we firmly believe in the concept of reproducible research.

Thus, we release the codes of simulation, algorithm development, and testing online on GitHub for the paper "A robust star identification algorithm with star shortlisting" (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2018.02.029>).

This repository contains the codes for simulation and testing of the star identification algorithm based on worst case patch mismatch and running sequential angular match technique which is proposed in the paper. 

Please cite our paper appropriately if you use these codes in your research for development, simulation or testing of a new star identification algorithm or comparison & benchmarking with the above-mentioned algorithm, We welcome any questions regarding the code.

This code is only for academic and research purposes.
